# RunWithPerfectIntervals

This code snippet allows you to run any python function with perfect intervals.

# How It Works

When you want to run a code every x seconds,
you can do it by sleeping x seconds after each execution.

This method is not very accurate because your intervals are now x seconds + execution time.

I created this small project that allows you to subtract the execution time from the sleeping time to ensure that the timing is just perfect!
